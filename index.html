<p>何为 yak shaving？要去买个水管，得开车出去；但路上要交过桥费；为了避免交过桥费，得去跟邻居借张通行卡；但邻居是不会把卡借给我的，因为前些时候跟他家借的枕头还没还给他；但枕头里的棉絮掉了不少，你得找些替代品填充回去，才敢还给人家；哪里找填充物？去动物园撸 yak （牦牛）身上的毛。所以，为了去买水管，得先去动物园撸 yak 毛。<br><a href="https://seths.blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that/?utm_source=wanqu.co&amp;utm_campaign=Wanqu+Daily&amp;utm_medium=website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">原文链接</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The single best term I’ve learned this year.</p>
<p>Apparently turned into a computer term by the MIT media lab five years ago, yak shaving was recently referenced by my pal Joi Ito. (Link: Joi Ito’s Web: Yak Shaving)</p>
<p>I want to give you the non-technical definition, and as is my wont, broaden it a bit.</p>
<p>Yak Shaving is the last step of a series of steps that occurs when you find something you need to do. “I want to wax the car today.”</p>
<p>“Oops, the hose is still broken from the winter. I’ll need to buy a new one at Home Depot.”</p>
<p>“But Home Depot is on the other side of the Tappan Zee bridge and getting there without my EZPass is miserable because of the tolls.”</p>
<p>“But, wait! I could borrow my neighbor’s EZPass…”</p>
<p>“Bob won’t lend me his EZPass until I return the mooshi pillow my son borrowed, though.”</p>
<p>“And we haven’t returned it because some of the stuffing fell out and we need to get some yak hair to restuff it.”</p>
<p>And the next thing you know, you’re at the zoo, shaving a yak, all so you can wax your car.</p>
<p>This yak shaving phenomenon tends to hit some people more than others, but what makes it particularly perverse is when groups of people get involved. It’s bad enough when one person gets all up in arms yak shaving, but when you try to get a group of people together, you’re just as likely to end up giving the yak a manicure.</p>
<p>Which is why solo entrepreneurs and small organizations are so much more likely to get stuff done. They have fewer yaks to shave.</p>
<p>So, what to do?</p>
<p>Don’t go to Home Depot for the hose.</p>
<p>The minute you start walking down a path toward a yak shaving party, it’s worth making a compromise. Doing it well now is much better than doing it perfectly later.</p>

<p>Schools train us to provide the right answers to predefined questions. Yet anyone with experience from the real world knows that, more often than not, the difficult part is to find the right question.</p>
<p>To make a remarkable contribution, you need to start by asking the right question. I will go further than this: the questions you are asking might define who you are.</p>
<p>What is a good question?</p>
<ul>
<li>The great questions are tractable and fruitful. They lead you on a path of discovery. It is easy to ask how to cure cancer, but that’s not a good question because it does not help anyone do medical research.</li>
<li>Secret questions are the best: if you are the only one with this question in mind, then you may be holding a gold mine. Questions that everyone is having are proportionally worthless. (E.g., see Zero to One by Peter Thiel)<br>You may think that by studying hard, by learning all the answers, you will get better at asking great questions. I am not sure it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, knowing too much can harm you. I would take a B student who has fresh questions as a Ph.D. student over a typical overeager A+ student who frets about getting everything right. It is a poorly held secret that some of the very best researchers and innovators were average students.</p>
<p>Do the following experiment. Pick a scholarly field, any field, then spend two weeks reading everything about it that you can. Next, write down 5 questions. I can almost guarantee you that these 5 questions will be already covered by sources you read. They will be “known” questions.</p>
<p>So to find good questions, you have to maintain some distance from the material. This should be uncontroversial if you consider that I define “good questions” to be “secret” or “highly original”.</p>
<p>Our minds tend to frame everything in terms of the patterns we have learned. Spend two years studying Marxism and every single problem will feel like a Marxist problem to you. It becomes difficult for you to come up with new questions outside of the frame.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: smart people who know more tend to be more creative, everything else being equal… but there is a difference between being knowledgeable and having been locked into a frame of mind.</p>
<p>Yet here is how many researchers work. They survey the best papers from the last major conference or journal issue in their field. Importantly, they make sure to read what everyone is reading and to make sure to make theirs the frame of minds of the best people. They make sure that they can repeat the most popular questions and answers. They look at the papers, look for holes or possibilities for improvement and work from there. What this ensures that there are a few leaders (people writing about genuine novel ideas) followed by a long and nearly endless stream of “me too” papers that offer minor and inconsequential variations.</p>
<p>It is easier to judge these things in retrospect. In computer science, we had the XML craze at the turn of the century. Dozens of XML papers appeared each year at each of the top database conferences. I wrote about the untold story of the death of this idea. How could so many people get so excited at the same time by what was a dead-end?</p>
<p>I believe that people are happy to be handed out questions and will often rush out to provide highly sophisticated thorough answers… whether or not the question is the right one.</p>
<p>My claim is that the people leading are not unnaturally smart, knowledgeable or creative. The people who answer other people’s questions are not dumb or unimaginative. The main difference is one of focus. You either focus on asking good questions or you focus on providing good answers.</p>
<p>The world would be better if we had more people asking better questions.</p>
<p>How might we ask better questions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to what is around you and violates your worldview. How did Fleming discover penicillin? He noticed that some mold that had invaded his dirty lab appeared to kill bacteria. He asked the right question at that time.<br>Be patient. Reportedly, Einstein once stated, “It’s Not That I’m so Smart, It’s Just That I Stay with Problems Longer.” The longer you work on a problem, the more likely you are to find interesting questions. (See Forthmann et al. 2018) The easiest way to miss the great questions is to dismiss the problems as uninteresting and move on too quickly.</li>
<li>Be physically active, go for a walk. Chaining yourself to a desk is likely counterproductive. I used to think that being an all-out intellectual was the best route, but I now believe that I was grossly mistaken. I personally take a walk outside almost every morning on weekdays. (See Oppezzo and Schwartz, 2014).<br>Don’t be too social. Social pressure toward conformity trigger intense instinctive reactions. It is simply hard to go against the herd. Thus you are better off not know too much about where the herd is. In concrete terms, spend entirely days by yourself.Â Bernstein et al.Â (2018) recommend intermittent social interactions, as opposed to continuous interactions, to avoid a reduction in individual exploration.</li>
<li>Ask a lot of questions. If you want to become good at providing the right answers, train yourself to answer lots of questions. If you want to become good at asking questions, ask a lot of them.</li>
<li>Always question your own thoughts and work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scientific mind does not so much provide the right answers as ask the right questions. (attributed to Levi-Strauss)</p>

<p><strong>当key == null 或者不存在时，才compute。该方法看起来有点多余，如果计算不涉及key，可以直接用<code>putIfAbsent()</code>代替。</strong></p>
<p>源码略。</p>
<p>##computeIfPresent()<br><code>compute()</code>的补充，key存在时才<code>compute()</code>，避免潜在的空指针情况。其他和<code>compute()</code>相同。<br>源码略。</p>

            <p>There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.</p>
<p>Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).</p>
<p>You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nums1 = [1, 3]<br>nums2 = [2]<br>The median is 2.0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nums1 = [1, 2]<br>nums2 = [3, 4]<br>The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>两个已排序的int数组，求中间值。时间复杂度必须是O(log(m+n))</p>

<p>很快写完了，测试结果3ms，效率还ok。这道题居然这么简单吗？<br>仔细一看题干要求，时间复杂度！<code>O(log(m+n))</code> ！我的解法最高只能做到<code>O((m+n)/2)</code>,其实不符合要求。<br>涉及到log的算法必然要用二分法，所以，重新审视下这个问题。<br><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">38</span><br><span class="line">39</span><br><span class="line">40</span><br><span class="line">41</span><br><span class="line">42</span><br><span class="line">43</span><br><span class="line">44</span><br><span class="line">45</span><br><span class="line">46</span><br><span class="line">47</span><br><span class="line">48</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Solution</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">double</span> <span class="title">findMedianSortedArrays</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">int</span>[] arr1, <span class="keyword">int</span>[] arr2)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">int</span> length1 = arr1.length;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">int</span> length2 = arr2.length;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (length1 &gt;

<p>最终并没有自己想到解法，看了其他人的图解，才恍然大悟。<br>这个solution有一个思路，把两个有序数组A、B个分成两份，<code>A左 + B左 = A右 + B右</code>时就能找到中间值。</p>

          <p>因为前端休产假，接过了一个vue项目临时维护。<br>笔者是一个javaer，以前有过使用React的经验，所以并非一个0基础前端，也不是一个老式的jquery前端er。如果没有使用三大前端框架的经验，可能无法很快上手。</p>
<p>其实很早以前就瞄过vue的文档，毕竟vue是尤大开发的，中文文档那叫一个健全。相比之下16年我学react，那叫一个两眼一抹黑，中文搜索结果 es5 混合着 es6，api还有小更新，痛苦得很。<br>
